I am currently a PhD student at LPSM from Sorbonne University and Nokia Bell Labs. I had my bachelor's degree in mathematical engineering and my master's diploma in applied mathematics at University of Chile. I am interested in industrial research related to probability, statistics and data analysis.

My current research is focus on survival analysis.
